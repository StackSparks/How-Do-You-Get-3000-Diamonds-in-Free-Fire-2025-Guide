**Method 2: Use Free Fire‚Äôs ‚ÄúDiamond Giveaway‚Äù Promotions**

Free Fire frequently runs Diamond Giveaway promotions. During these campaigns, players can earn free Diamonds by completing certain actions, such as logging in to the game daily, referring friends, or participating in community events.
